<p>Allows to calculate the distance between texts according to the optimal string alignment distance
(abbreviated as OSA distance, also referred to as "restricted edit distance" or "restricted
Damerau-Levenshtein distance"). The OSA distance measures the number of single-character edits
(insertions, deletions, substitutions) and transpositions of two adjacent characters that are
needed to make the texts equal to each other. Unlike the Damerau-Levensthein distance, the OSA
distance does not allow substrings to be edited more than once. Furthermore, it does not meet the
properties of the triangle inequality.</p>
<p>In natural language processing words are often short and misspellings usually do not affect more
than 2 characters. Therefore, - despite its limitations - the OSA distance can be used as an
efficient approximation of the unrestricted Damerau-Levenshtein distance in such scenarios.</p>
